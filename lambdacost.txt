 The lowest example would be to allocate 128 MB of memory within the limit of 3.2 million seconds per month. The price per 100ms would be $US 0.000000208.(per second  $US 0.00000208)
 
 128mb memory size:
 
 per min  no of seconds       60
 per hour no of seconds       3600
 per day no of seconds        86400
 per month total of seconds  (2592000)
 
 
 per second(request)             0.000000208(100ms) * 10 = $US 0.00000208
 
 3 million seconds(requests)     0.00000208 * 3000000    = $US 2.08
 
Let say, if you allocated 512 MB of memory to your function and executed it 3 million times during one months time. Considering that it ran for 1 second each time, youâ€™d be billed upon monthly compute time (in this case = $18.34) and by monthly requests (in this case = $0.40). Therefore, the total billed sum would be $18.74 per month.

request cost = no of requests * 

total_cost =  request cost  + execution cost(100ms)

total_cost =
